Originally Bishop Miguel de Benavides, O.P. initiated the establishment of this institution to prepare young men for the priesthood, his personal library and funds became the start of UST’s history. UST has played a big role in shaping the education, Catholicism, and culture of the Philippines for over four centuries.

Today, UST proudly holds the title of being the largest Catholic university in the world located on a single campus. With their mission that aims to develop knowledgeable, competent, and compassionate individuals guided by faith and reason, dedicated to serving the Church, the nation, and the world. Along with their vision that by 2030, the University of Santo Tomas envisions becoming a leading Catholic university in the Asia-Pacific, dedicated to holistic education and social transformation. UST truly serves as an important asset to the students' morals and the Philippines' future generations to come.
